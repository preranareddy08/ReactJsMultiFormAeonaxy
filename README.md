# Aeonaxy assignment submission Multistep form
Developed a dynamic Multi-Step Form Application using React.js, designed to streamline user data collection through a sequential and user-friendly interface. The application is structured with several steps, each progressively gathering more detailed user information. Utilizing React's component-based architecture, I created reusable form elements to ensure modularity and maintainability. State management was efficiently handled using React's useState and useContext hooks, allowing for seamless propagation of form data across different steps.
